Coursera and Rice University have offered course An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1).
The course is designed to offer interaction with the CodeSculptor - http://www.codeskulptor.org which is a a 
browser-based Python interpreter. CodeSculptor implements a subset of Python 2, plus the addition of three 
graphical libraries, SimpleGui, SimpleMap, and SimplePlot. 

Without these additional libraries you cannot run most of the scripts, but you can do it on CodeSculptor in
